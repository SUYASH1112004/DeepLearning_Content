It was a hot afternoon, and a lion was sleeping under a tree when a small mouse ran over his nose. 
This made the lion wake up and, feeling disturbed, he threatened to eat it after trapping the mouse under his paw. 
The terrified mouse begged for mercy, saying, "Please let me go, and one day, I shall repay your kindness!"
The lion was entertained by the idea of the little creature helping him and released it. Some days later, the lion found himself caught in a hunter's net. 
His powerful roars for help reached the mouse, who quickly arrived and started gnawing at the ropes. Soon, the lion was free. 
Overwhelmed with gratitude, the lion realized how even the smallest creature could make a big difference.
